Spillover Effects

The emergence of COVID-19, a zoonotic disease, serves as a dramatic example of how biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation increase opportunities for pathogens to move between wildlife and humans. Anthropogenic actions like land-use change, intensive livestock production, wildlife trade, and climate change intensify the interface where wild hosts, vectors, and humans interact, raising the risk of novel spillover events and future pandemics. When natural habitats are destroyed or degraded, edge areas between natural and human environments expand, leading to more frequent human–wildlife encounters and greater pathogen transmission potential.​

Moreover, the pandemic itself disrupts conservation funding, environmental policy, and sustainable tourism, indirectly creating feedback loops that can further undermine ecosystem stability and exacerbate drivers of disease emergence. Decisions relating to post-pandemic economic stimulus, such as subsidies for extractive industries, may unintentionally increase pressures on biodiversity making future outbreaks more likely. Implementing a One Health approach, which integrates the health of people, animals, and ecosystems, has become increasingly recognized as essential for preventing the next pandemic by strengthening cross-sector collaboration and policy coherence.
