Here are 10 recent papers (2023–2025) extending the themes of regime shift detection, early warning signals (EWS), critical slowing down, Bayesian/HMM methods, spectral analysis, and non-equilibrium dynamics in climate/ecosystems, building directly on clusters like Scheffer (XVI), Boettner & Boers (VIII), and AMOC works (XXXIV/XXXVI).[1][2]

## Marine & Plankton Regime Detection
- **Poor performance of regime shift detection methods in marine ecosystems** (ICES J. Mar. Sci., 2025): Tests STARS, Strucchange, EnvCpt on Norwegian Sea time series, quantifying false positives in noisy data—echoes Rodionov (XVIII) limitations.[1]
- **A novel multispecies approach for regime shifts in North Sea plankton** (Ocean Sci., 2025): HMM-like sequential anomaly detection across 300+ species, validating 1960s–2010s shifts with low false negatives.[2]

## Climate & Hydroclimate Shifts
- **Super El Niño events drive climate regime shifts** (Nat. Commun., 2025): Data-driven CRS identification via spectral clustering, linking to volatility like Swain et al. (LVI).[4]
- **Shifting dominant periods in extreme climate impacts** (2025): De-trended projections show climate-driven spectral shifts to shorter periods, extending Froyland (IX).[5]
- **Physics of AMOC multistable regime shifts** (Earth Syst. Dynam., 2025): Model biases in freshwater flux analyzed for hysteresis, advancing Van Westen (XXXIV).[6]

## Terrestrial & Ice Systems
- **Antarctic Sea Ice: Record lows 2022–2025 as regime shift** (Environments Aotearoa, 2025): EWS evidence of fundamental change, tying to Arctic (XVII) and snow loss (III).[9]
- **Identifying regime shifts, transients, and EWS for terrestrial ecosystems** (Biol. Conserv., 2023/2024): Tipping in soils/forests with flickering precursors, per Dakos (XII).[7]

## Trait-Based & Predictive Modeling
- **Merging trait-based ecology and regime shift theory** (Glob. Change Biol., 2023): Anticipates community tipping via traits + EWS, bridging Scheffer (XVI) and bees (XXXVIII).[8]
- **Regime shifts, trends in lake productivity** (PNAS, 2022/2023 update): Change-point detection on global TSI data shows rising shift frequency.[3]

These amplify your list's physics-to-ML pipeline: e.g., North Sea multispecies mirrors TIP-GAN (XXXVII) for generative detection, while AMOC physics uses variational methods like Brinkerhoff (VI). For notebooks, adapt their GitHub code (e.g., ) into non-stationary GPs.[1]
