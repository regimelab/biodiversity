### GDP and Natural Capital

Traditional GDP counts market activity but ignores **ecosystem services** like pollination, water filtration, and soil fertility — the “silent” inputs to production. Studies from the World Bank and the OECD estimate that **50–60% of global GDP depends on nature’s services**, meaning the real economy rests on a bio-physical base that GDP doesn’t measure.

When ecosystems degrade, the *actual productivity capacity* falls, even if *measured productivity* (in dollar terms) appears to rise due to digital or AI-sector growth. This is the same disconnect that environmental economists call the **GDP–natural capital paradox**.

### Baumol’s Cost Disease and Structural Shift

Your reference to *Baumol and Denison* spotlights a crucial dynamic: as economies shift labor from low-monetized but ecologically vital sectors (like agriculture or forestry) to high-GDP, low-labor sectors (like AI, software, or finance), overall measured productivity rises — but ecological resilience erodes.

This labor reallocation distorts growth metrics:
- High-productivity sectors (e.g., tech) inflate GDP via capital intensity.
- Low-productivity, high-ecosystem-value sectors shrink, worsening biodiversity loss and long-term natural capital depreciation.

### AI’s Ecological Externalities

AI’s current trajectory deepens this imbalance:
- **Energy demand:** AI could consume **2–10% of U.S. electricity by 2030**, driving water stress and grid emissions.
- **Cooling water use:** Data centers require **1–5 liters per kWh**, often in water-scarce regions.
- **Resource extraction:** Critical mineral mining (e.g., for GPUs) worsens habitat loss and pollution.
- **Emissions:** By 2030, global AI-related emissions could exceed **500 Mt CO₂e/year**, roughly aviation’s scale.

These physical inputs degrade the same natural systems that underpin “real” productivity growth — soil, biodiversity, and climate regulation. Yet GDP counts this as positive investment activity.

### AI’s Positive Potential — But Net Extractive Trend

AI can and does support **ecosystem monitoring** (e.g., species recognition, deforestation detection, bioacoustic biodiversity indices). However, these benefits mostly offset only a fraction of its physical and energy footprint.

In macroeconomic terms, its **restorative productivity** lags its **extractive footprint**. Without integrating natural capital accounting into GDP (e.g., via a “Gross Ecosystem Product” or ecologically adjusted productivity index), global growth may be statistically inflated while net biophysical productivity declines.

### Toward an Ecological Productivity Metric

You propose a “physical-output” or “real productivity” measure excluding capital investment distortions — this aligns with:
- **Inclusive Wealth Index (UNEP)** – tracks produced, human, and natural capital.
- **Daly & Farley’s steady-state economics** – calls for maintaining natural capital stocks.
- **Energy Return on Investment (EROI)** and **Material Flow Accounting (MFA)** frameworks – use biophysical inputs to assess real efficiency.

Such metrics could expose how current AI-led growth *extracts from future productivity* by degrading ecosystem inputs faster than technological efficiency can compensate.
