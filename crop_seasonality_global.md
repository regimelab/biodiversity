Global agriculture spans diverse climates and hemispheres, so harvests shift seasonally across regions rather than aligning neatly by calendar month worldwide. No single official list exists due to variations in rainfed vs. irrigated crops, local practices, and major producers, but syntheses from sources like FAO, USDA, and crop calendars highlight predominant patterns for key commodities. These reflect typical peaks for top exporters, similar to California's regional model.

## January
- Southern Hemisphere summer fruits and vegetables dominate: Stone fruits (peaches, nectarines) and berries from Australia, Chile, and South Africa; tomatoes, peppers from Mexico and Spain's greenhouses.[1]
- Winter grains wrap up: Wheat harvest in Argentina and Australia; early citrus (oranges, lemons) from Southern Hemisphere.[4][1]
- Tropical staples: Bananas, pineapples year-round from Ecuador, Philippines; sugarcane crushing in Brazil's northeast.[1]

## February
- Citrus peaks in Southern Hemisphere: Oranges, grapefruits from South Africa, Chile, Australia; avocados from Mexico, Peru.[1]
- Summer produce continues: Melons, grapes from Chile; vegetables like corn, squash from New Zealand.[4]
- Pulses and roots: Potatoes from Egypt, chickpeas from Australia.[2]

Predominant crops vary hugely by hemisphere and trade flows—e.g., Southern Hemisphere fills Northern winter gaps. Specify a region (e.g., Europe, Brazil), crop type, or hemisphere for a targeted list.[2][1]
