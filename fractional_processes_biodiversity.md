Fractal patterns, long-range dependence (LRD), and Hurst exponents from Mandelbrot's work extend to biodiversity and ecosystems, where self-similar structures and memory effects mirror financial volatility clustering.

## Biodiversity Parallels
Ecosystems display fractal-like self-similarity across scales, from branching river networks to species distributions, with LRD evident in species abundance time series—slow-decaying autocorrelations indicate persistent community structures rather than random fluctuations.[1][2]

Higher biodiversity strengthens ecosystem functioning over time, akin to persistent Hurst exponents (H > 0.5), enhancing resilience through complementary species interactions that buffer against shocks.

## Climate Change Links
Climate variability introduces long-memory patterns in ecological time series, like temperature or precipitation, amplifying volatility clustering in species dynamics—low H values signal mean-reversion in stressed systems, while biodiversity mitigates cascading failures.[3][9]

Feedback loops in diverse ecosystems create LRD in recovery processes post-disturbance, making them more stable under climate shifts than low-diversity ones, where rapid volatility bursts lead to tipping points.[4]
