Global supply chains for goods and services rely on productive inputs like energy, metals, semiconductors, labor, and logistics, with seasonality driven by weather, harvests, monsoons, and hemispheres. Vital commodities include oil, natural gas, copper, lithium, rare earths, and grains/soy for food/feed; tech chains depend on silicon wafers, cobalt, and DRAM chips from concentrated regions like Taiwan and DRC. Seasonal effects amplify bottlenecks, such as monsoon-disrupted mining in India/China (June-September) or winter port freezes in Russia/North China (December-February), per conversation patterns from agricultural calendars [conversation_history].

## Key Commodities
- **Energy**: Oil (Middle East peaks winter demand), natural gas (EU shortages in Q4-Q1 from Russian pipeline seasonality).[1]
- **Metals/Minerals**: Copper (Chile rains delay Q1 mining), lithium (Australia dry season harvest Nov-Mar), rare earths (China monsoons slow Jun-Sep processing).
- **Agriculture**: Soy/corn (US harvest Sep-Nov, Brazil Feb-May), palm oil (Indonesia/Malaysia peaks dry season Mar-Aug).
- **Tech Inputs**: Semiconductors (Taiwan typhoon season Jul-Oct disrupts TSMC), cobalt (DRC rainy season Oct-May reduces output 20-30%).

## Seasonal Bottlenecks
Hurricanes/typhoons hit refining/logistics hardest in Jul-Oct (Gulf Coast, East Asia); Northern Hemisphere winters strain LNG shipping Feb-Mar. Monsoons in South Asia/Africa cut coal/metal transport 15-25% Jun-Sep; El Niño/La Niña shift grain yields unpredictably, spiking food prices Q3-Q4.[6]

| Supply Chain | Vital Input | Peak Season Risk | Major Producers |
|--------------|-------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Global Goods | Oil, Wheat | Winter demand (Dec-Feb), Harvest fail (Q3 NH) | Saudi, US, Russia |
| Tech | Silicon, Cobalt | Typhoons (Jul-Oct), Rains (Oct-May) | Taiwan, DRC |
| Services/Logistics | Labor, Ports | Monsoon (Jun-Sep Asia), Freeze (Dec-Feb NH) | China ports, India roads [7] |

## Scarcity Risks
Biggest chokepoints: Taiwan Strait (90% advanced chips, typhoon/geopolitics), Panama Canal drought (dry season Jan-Apr cuts capacity 30%), Red Sea (winter fog/storms exacerbate disruptions). 2025 tariffs/geopolitics worsen these, with talent shortages and climate extremes (wildfires/floods) creating persistent gaps; nearshoring urged but slow.[5][1][6]
