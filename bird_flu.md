Several open-access papers explicitly link avian influenza (“bird flu”) spillover risk to ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss. These studies show that habitat change, land-use intensification, and reduced species diversity can increase contact among wild birds, poultry, and humans, making spillover more likely.[1][3][5][6][8]

## Key avian‑influenza–focused papers

- A 2025 PNAS study on the East Asian–Australasian Flyway models how wetland loss and agricultural landscape change in China reshaped migratory waterfowl distributions, increased bird aggregation, boosted wild–poultry contacts, and greatly elevated reassortment rates of avian influenza viruses in poultry as a proxy for emergence risk.[1]
- A 2025 paper on avian influenza spillover into poultry analyzes how proximity to infected wild bird populations, local environmental conditions, and farm-level biosecurity jointly determine spillover risks at the wildlife–agriculture interface.[3]
- Earlier work on H5N1 “evolutionary and social ecology” discusses how dense poultry production, live-bird trade, and ecological changes expand the potential transmission arena between wild and domestic birds, providing conditions for spillover and viral evolution.[9]

## Biodiversity loss and zoonotic risk

- A 2020 review on biodiversity loss and emerging pathogens synthesizes evidence that habitat degradation, reduced species diversity, and increased wildlife–human contact contribute to rising zoonotic disease emergence, including avian influenza among other infections.[8]
- A review on how biodiversity loss compromises human and animal health describes how deforestation, agricultural expansion, and homogenized landscapes increase contact among wildlife, livestock, and people, explicitly citing H5N1 outbreaks linked to intensive poultry systems and altered bird breeding environments.[2]
- An EU policy analysis on biodiversity loss and disease outlines how forest loss, fragmentation, and proximity of livestock and settlements to remaining natural habitats raise spillover risk, using several zoonoses (including vector‑borne and bat‑borne diseases) as examples of this mechanism.[5]

## Land‑use change, degradation, and pandemics

- The IPBES Workshop Report on Biodiversity and Pandemics estimates that land‑use change, agricultural expansion, and urbanization account for a large fraction of emerging infectious disease events and emphasizes that habitat destruction and encroachment into biodiverse areas create new wildlife–livestock–human interfaces for pathogen spillover.[6]
- A review of wildlife health in rapidly changing Arctic systems notes that climate‑driven habitat shifts, wetland changes, and altered species ranges can increase contact between previously segregated bird populations and other hosts, opening new opportunities for avian pathogen spillover.[4]
- A 2024 analysis of highly pathogenic H5N1 treats the current global H5N1 situation as a “paradigmatic” case linking intensive livestock production, environmental change, and cross‑species spillover, including into mammals.[7]

## Suggestions for literature searching

When searching databases (e.g., Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed), combining terms helps narrow to this niche:

- “highly pathogenic avian influenza” OR “H5N1” OR “H5Nx”  
- AND “land-use change” OR “habitat loss” OR “wetland degradation” OR “agricultural expansion”  
- AND “biodiversity loss” OR “species richness” OR “ecosystem degradation” OR “spillover” OR “wildlife‑livestock interface”[6][8][1]

These combinations should surface both disease‑specific papers (HPAI in birds and poultry) and broader One Health and biodiversity–pandemic frameworks that discuss avian influenza as a case study.[5][8][1]
