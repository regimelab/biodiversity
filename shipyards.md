Abandoned waterfront properties like old factories and shipyards can be transformed into labs for rewilding and biodiversity conservation by integrating ecological design, community science, and habitat restoration.[1][3][7]

### Ecological Design and Habitat Restoration
These sites can be redesigned to include native vegetation, wetlands, tidal pools, and oyster reefs, which provide habitat for diverse species and enhance ecosystem services such as water filtration and flood protection. For example, former industrial sites have been turned into parks with thousands of native plants, nesting habitats, and marine restoration features like oyster shell tiles, supporting fish, birds, and pollinators.[3][7][1]

### Community Science and Education
Converting these spaces into research labs can involve local universities, citizen scientists, and community groups in monitoring species, testing restoration techniques, and educating the public. Projects like Seattle’s new seawall and Detroit’s waterfront parks serve as living laboratories, where ecological data is collected and restoration methods are demonstrated to the public.[7][3]

### Practical Steps
- Remove contaminants and invasive species to prepare the site for native plants and animals.[2]
- Install green infrastructure such as constructed wetlands, native plantings, and tidal pools.[1][3]
- Design research stations and observation decks for monitoring biodiversity and engaging the community.[7]
- Partner with local institutions to run restoration experiments and educational programs.[3][7]

These approaches turn underutilized waterfronts into hubs for biodiversity, research, and community engagement, making them powerful tools for ecological recovery and public education.[1][3][7]
