### Core Concept

The **economic impact of biodiversity loss** is defined as the change in the total (market + non‑market) economic value of goods and services that California’s ecosystems provide, caused by declines in species or habitat condition. It captures how biodiversity change translates into measurable costs for people, businesses, and governments—whether through reduced production, higher damage costs, or loss of welfare.

### Two Main Impact Channels

1. **Market‑based impacts** — Direct losses to economic sectors that depend on biodiversity, such as:
   - **Agriculture** (e.g., reduced yields from pollinator decline in almond orchards).  
   - **Fisheries and forestry** (e.g., collapse of kelp‑dependent fisheries or wildfire damage).  
   - **Tourism and recreation** (e.g., fewer park visits or degraded scenic quality).  

2. **Non‑market impacts** — Losses to *ecosystem services* without direct prices but crucial to human well‑being:
   - Flood and fire protection from wetlands and forests.  
   - Carbon sequestration, air purification, water filtration, and heat moderation.  
   - Cultural and aesthetic values tied to nature.

### Practical Definition

Formally, the economic impact equals the **change in net present value** of all ecosystem services due to biodiversity loss within a specific area. Analysts compute it as:

\[
\text{Economic impact} = V_{\text{baseline}} - V_{\text{after biodiversity loss}}
\]

where \(V\) denotes the total economic value (market + non‑market) of ecosystem services.

### Four‑Step Measurement Framework

1. **Measure ecological change** – Quantify changes in biodiversity (species richness, abundance, habitat quality).  
2. **Link to ecosystem services** – Model how those changes affect biophysical outputs (pollination, water flow, erosion).  
3. **Assign economic value** – Use market prices, avoided damages, or non‑market valuation methods.  
4. **Aggregate results** – Express as lost revenue, increased costs, or welfare changes at the desired scale (city, county, region).

### California Applications

- **Pollinator loss** threatens tens of billions in agricultural output (especially almonds and fruits).  
- **Habitat degradation** reduces park and recreation income worth billions annually.  
- **Urban tree loss** increases energy and healthcare costs, given their $1 + billion yearly value in cooling and air quality.  
- **Wildfires and deforestation** weaken water reliability and carbon storage—raising downstream costs.

### Policy Relevance

This framework enables California agencies, counties, and finance offices to:
- Quantify biodiversity’s economic contribution.  
- Compare the costs of biodiversity loss with the costs of conservation.  
- Integrate ecosystem value into **budgeting, risk assessment, and land‑use planning.**

It shifts biodiversity from being seen as a purely ecological issue to a **core economic and fiscal concern** for the state.
