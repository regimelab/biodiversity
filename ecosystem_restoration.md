### Habitat Restoration and Green Spaces
Restoring riparian zones, wetlands, and native vegetation can quickly improve ecosystem services like water filtration, flood control, and wildlife habitat. Community-led projects to plant native trees, shrubs, and wildflowers in parks, schoolyards, and along streets can increase biodiversity and resilience, especially in historically underserved neighborhoods where green space is limited.[3][7][1]

### Sustainable Agriculture
Incorporating biodiversity into farming—such as planting hedgerows, cover crops, and pollinator strips—can boost ecosystem services like pest control, pollination, and soil health. These practices are relatively easy to implement and can benefit both farmers and local wildlife.[2][6]

### Urban Planning and Equity
Prioritizing green infrastructure in urban areas, especially in neighborhoods with legacy environmental disparities, can reduce heat islands, improve air quality, and support greater species richness. Community engagement in local restoration projects and equitable access to green spaces are key for lasting impact.[7]

### Key Actions
- Restore and expand native habitats, especially riparian and wetland areas.[1][3]
- Integrate biodiversity-friendly practices in agriculture, such as hedgerows and cover crops.[6][2]
- Increase green space and tree canopy in urban and historically underserved communities.[7]
- Engage local residents in restoration and stewardship activities to build community resilience.

These actions are practical, scalable, and can yield immediate benefits for both ecosystems and people in California communities.[2][1][7]
