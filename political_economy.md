The political overlap in California's biodiversity loss is deeply intertwined with the historical and ongoing exploitation of Indigenous lands. Colonial policies, forced removal, and the imposition of Western land-use practices have systematically disrupted Indigenous stewardship, leading to ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss that persists today. Indigenous communities, who for millennia managed landscapes through practices like controlled burning and seasonal harvesting, were displaced during the Gold Rush and subsequent waves of colonization, resulting in population decline, loss of traditional knowledge, and ecological imbalance.[1][3][4][6]

### Exploitation of Indigenous Lands

- California's Indigenous peoples lost over 90% of their ancestral territory due to violent displacement, forced labor, and discriminatory laws.[3][6][1]
- Their stewardship practices—such as fire management and rotational harvesting—maintained biodiversity and ecosystem resilience, but were suppressed by settler governments and replaced with industrial logging, agriculture, and fire suppression, accelerating habitat loss and species decline.[4][7]
- The removal of Indigenous management led to the decline of species like salmon, elk, and prairie plants, as well as increased vulnerability to wildfires and drought.[7][1][4]

### Cultural and Political Dimensions

- The erosion of Indigenous land rights and cultural practices is not just an ecological issue but a reflection of systemic injustice embedded in California's political and economic culture.[6][3]
- Modern conservation efforts often overlook Indigenous knowledge, despite evidence that Indigenous-managed lands have higher biodiversity and are more resilient to climate change.[2][1][7]
- The "Land Back" movement and recent land returns to tribes are attempts to correct historical wrongs and restore Indigenous stewardship, but these efforts are still limited and face political resistance.[1][2]

### Cultural Legacy

- The loss of Indigenous land stewardship is engrained in California’s culture, where economic development has historically prioritized resource extraction over ecological balance and community well-being.[8][3][6]
- Recognizing and integrating Indigenous knowledge into policy is essential for reversing biodiversity loss and addressing the underlying social injustices that have shaped California’s environmental challenges.[7][8][1]

This history reveals that biodiversity loss in California is not only an ecological crisis but also a legacy of colonialism, cultural erasure, and political exclusion, which continues to shape the state’s approach to land and resource management.[3][6][1][7]
