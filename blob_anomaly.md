The recent return of the "Blob" refers to a massive marine heatwave, designated NEP25A, that emerged in the Northeast Pacific in May 2025 and peaked in summer. This event ranks as the fourth-largest on record, covering about 8 million square kilometers—roughly the size of the contiguous U.S.—from the Gulf of Alaska down to Baja California and across much of the North Pacific basin.[1][2][8]

## Timeline and Scale
This Blob began in early May 2025 in the Gulf of Alaska, rapidly expanding by late July to set a new record for North Pacific sea surface temperature anomalies in August, the highest since records began in the late 1800s. By September, it stretched roughly 5,000 miles, influencing areas from Japan to the U.S. West Coast, with temperatures 2–4°C above normal in key spots.[2][6][1]

## Causes
Persistent weak winds and stagnant high- and low-pressure systems reduced upwelling of cooler deep water, allowing surface heat to accumulate, much like the original 2013 event. Climate change amplified this through rapid North Pacific warming—the fastest of any ocean basin over the past decade—making such heatwaves more frequent and intense.[3][1]

## Current Status
By late September to November 2025, the Blob began weakening due to stronger fall winds, atmospheric rivers, and vertical mixing, lowering risks of persistence into winter. It's now more surface-confined and transient compared to the deeper 2013–2016 version.[8][1][3]

## Impacts and Outlook
Early signs include northward shifts of warm-water species like marlin and tuna, harmful algal blooms off Oregon, and die-offs of seabirds and marine mammals, though smaller than past events. It boosted Japan's record-hot summer and could alter U.S. winter weather, like enhancing atmospheric rivers for wetter California conditions or influencing jet stream patterns, but its fade reduces chances of extreme "polar vortex" cold in the Lower 48.[6][1][2][3]
