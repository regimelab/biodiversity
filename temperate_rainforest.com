**Northern California's temperate rainforests form a coastal ecoregion stretching from the Oregon border to Monterey County.**[1][3]

## Geographic Extent
The Northern California Coastal Forests ecoregion spans about 13,300 square kilometers, rarely extending beyond 65 km inland from the Pacific. Key zones include Del Norte and Humboldt counties northward with dense old-growth stands, transitioning southward through Mendocino, Sonoma, Marin, and into the Santa Cruz Mountains, with disjunct patches around Point Reyes and Big Basin Redwoods State Park.[3][1]

## Climate and Conditions
These forests thrive in a cool, mild climate (4–20°C) with 700-2,500 mm annual precipitation, mostly winter rain plus summer fog drip supplying moisture to redwoods. Unlike tropical rainforests, dry summers define the Mediterranean influence, yet fog and rugged microrefugia sustain lush growth in valleys and north-facing slopes.[5][1]

## Dominant Flora and Fauna
Coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) dominates lowlands alongside Douglas-fir, Sitka spruce, western hemlock, western red cedar, tanoak, and bigleaf maple; eight conifers are endemic. Understories feature ferns, mosses, and salamanders in canopy communities, with adjacent mixed evergreen forests, pygmy forests, bogs, and grasslands boosting biodiversity.[1][3]

## Major Parks and Preserves
Protected areas encompass Redwood National and State Parks (including Jedediah Smith), Humboldt Redwoods State Park, Headwaters Forest Reserve, King Range, Sinkyone Wilderness, Big Basin Redwoods, Henry Cowell Redwoods, and open spaces like Purisima Creek and Long Ridge.[4][3]

## Threats and Conservation
Old-growth logging reduced coverage, but 73% conservation targets exist; vulnerabilities include fire (exacerbated by 2020 CZU fires), drought, and warming climates stressing fog-dependent species. Rugged terrain aids refugia, yet invasive pests and development pressure persist.[11][1]
