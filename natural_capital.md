GDP-based productivity metrics overlook ecosystem dependencies, where natural capital underpins ~50-60% of global output through pollination, soil health, and water cycles, yet AI-driven growth inflates figures via energy-intensive infrastructure without bolstering this base.[1][2]

## Ecosystem Dependencies
Agriculture, fisheries, and raw materials—core "actual goods"—rely on biodiversity for resilience; losses from habitat conversion (e.g., data center land use) erode long-term productivity, echoing Baumol/Denison by shifting labor to high-GDP tech sectors while degrading low-productivity natural ones. AI capex boosts measured output now but consumes 2-10% of US electricity by 2030, stressing water for cooling (e.g., 1-5 liters per kWh) and rare earth mining, accelerating biodiversity decline without offsetting conservation gains.[3][9][1]

## AI's Dual Role
While AI aids monitoring (e.g., satellite species tracking, bioacoustics for ecosystem health), its net effect remains extractive: hyperscaler data centers fragment habitats and emit ~500 Mt CO2e annually by 2030, comparable to aviation, without proportional biodiversity credits or restoration. A physical-output measure excluding investment would expose this disconnect, revealing stagnant or declining "real" productivity as ecosystem services falter under energy demands.[4][1]
